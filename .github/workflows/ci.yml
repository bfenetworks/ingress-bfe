# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ develop ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "ci"
  ci:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        # Must fetch at least the immediate parents so that if this is
        # a pull request then we can checkout the head of the pull request.
        # Only include this option if you are running this workflow on pull requests.
        fetch-depth: 2

    # If this run was triggered by a pull request event then checkout
    # the head of the pull request instead of the merge commit.
    # Only include this step if you are running this workflow on pull requests.
